<h2>My Hobbies</h2>

  <p>
    I enjoy spending my free time watching anime and reading manga and comic books.
    I like how these stories combine strong characters, creativity, and deep themes
    that keep me interested. Anime and comics also help me relax and escape from daily
    stress while inspiring my imagination. Some stories motivate me by showing
    characters who overcome challenges through hard work and determination.

    Reading books is another hobby I value because it helps me learn and grow.
    Whether the books are fiction or educational, I enjoy gaining new perspectives
    and ideas. Reading improves my focus and helps me develop better thinking and
    communication skills. It also supports my academic and personal development by
    expanding my knowledge.

    In addition to entertainment, I enjoy learning new computer skills.
    I like exploring topics such as coding, web development, and technology because
    they challenge me to think logically and creatively. Learning new technical skills
    excites me because technology is always evolving, and it gives me the opportunity
    to improve myself and prepare for future career opportunities.
